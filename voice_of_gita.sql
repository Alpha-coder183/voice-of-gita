(24, 'i am too tensed what should i do\r\n', '\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna teaches us the importance of controlling our mind and emotions in times of stress and tension. In Chapter 2, Verse 48, He says, \"Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.\" This verse reminds us to focus on our actions and not worry about the outcome. We should do our best and leave the rest to the divine will. In Chapter 6, Verse 35, Lord Krishna also advises us to practice meditation to calm our mind and find inner peace. He says, \"For him who has conquered the mind, the mind is the best of friends; but for one who has failed to do so, his mind will remain the greatest enemy.\" Therefore, we must strive to control our thoughts and emotions through meditation and detachment from the results. Additionally, in Chapter 18, Verse 58, Lord Krishna reminds us to surrender our worries and anxieties to Him, saying, \"If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all the obstacles of conditioned life by My grace.\" This verse reminds us to have faith in the divine and trust that everything happens for a reason. By', 'Sreejit', '2024-11-27 17:26:29'),
(25, 'am i weak?\r\n', '\n\nIn the context of Bhagavad Gita, weakness is not defined by one\'s physical strength or abilities, but rather by one\'s mental state and spiritual understanding. In Chapter 2, verse 3, Lord Krishna says, \"The wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead.\" This means that a weak person is one who is attached to material possessions and relationships, and is unable to see the impermanence of life. In Chapter 6, verse 5, Lord Krishna also says, \"One must elevate oneself by one\'s own mind, not degrade oneself. The mind is the friend of the conditioned soul, and his enemy as well.\" This shows that weakness lies in one\'s own mind and thoughts, and it is up to us to strengthen our mind and overcome our weaknesses. Therefore, in the context of Bhagavad Gita, one is considered weak if they are unable to control their mind and senses, and are attached to material desires and attachments. However, with the teachings of the Gita, one can overcome their weaknesses and become strong in their spiritual understanding and inner strength.', 'Rivu', '2024-11-29 18:53:55'),
(26, 'ice cream\r\n', '\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna teaches us about the concept of detachment and how it is essential for leading a peaceful and fulfilling life. In Chapter 2, Verse 14, He says, \"O son of Kunti, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, O scion of Bharata, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.\" This verse reminds us that just like the temporary pleasure of eating ice cream, all material pleasures are fleeting and should not be the focus of our lives. Instead, we should strive for inner peace and detachment from material desires.', 'Rivu', '2024-11-29 18:54:27'),
(34, 'who is god?', '\r\n\r\nGod, in the context of Bhagavad Gita, is the supreme being who is the source of all existence and the ultimate goal of life.

(35, 'who is God\r\n', '\n\nAccording to the Bhagavad Gita, God is the ultimate and supreme being who is the creator, sustainer, and destroyer of the universe. He is known by many names such as Brahman, Ishvara, and Bhagavan. In Chapter 10, verse 8, Lord Krishna says, \"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.\" This verse highlights God\'s omnipotence and his role as the origin of all existence. In Chapter 15, verse 15, Lord Krishna also explains that God resides within every living being as the Supersoul, guiding and sustaining them. This shows God\'s omnipresence and his intimate connection with all beings. Ultimately, God is the ultimate source of love, wisdom, and liberation, and it is through devotion and surrender to Him that one can attain true happiness and enlightenment.', 'Rivu', '2024-11-29 21:11:24'),
(36, 'what is yog', '\n\nYoga, in the context of the Bhagavad Gita, refers to the path of spiritual discipline and union with the divine. It is described in Chapter 6, Verse 23 as the \"cessation of all material activities and merging of the self in the Supreme.\" This form of yoga is known as \"karma yoga\" and emphasizes selfless action and detachment from the fruits of one\'s actions. In Chapter 12, Verse 12, Krishna also describes the path of \"bhakti yoga,\" which involves devotion and surrender to the divine. Ultimately, yoga in the Bhagavad Gita is a means to attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death and achieve union with the divine.', 'Rivu', '2024-11-29 21:45:05'),
(37, 'what is yog', '\n\nYoga, in the context of Bhagavad Gita, refers to the practice of union with the divine. It is described as a state of complete harmony and balance between the mind, body, and spirit. In Chapter 6, verse 23, Lord Krishna says, \"The yogi who is established in self-realization and who has conquered the mind and senses is the highest of all beings; he is situated in Me and is never separated from Me.\" This verse highlights the ultimate goal of yoga, which is to attain oneness with the divine. The practice of yoga, as described in the Bhagavad Gita, involves controlling the mind and senses through various techniques such as meditation and self-discipline. It is a path towards spiritual enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.', 'Rivu', '2024-11-29 21:45:06'),
(38, 'why do meditation', '\n\nMeditation is a powerful tool for achieving inner peace and self-realization, as described in the Bhagavad Gita. In Chapter 6, Verse 11, Lord Krishna says, \"To practice yoga, one must first control the mind and senses.\" This control is achieved through meditation, which helps to calm the mind and bring it under our control. In Chapter 6, Verse 15, Lord Krishna explains that through regular practice of meditation, one can attain a state of peace and detachment from the material world. This detachment allows us to focus on our true self and connect with the divine within us. Thus, meditation is essential for spiritual growth and achieving the ultimate goal of self-realization, as taught in the Bhagavad Gita.', 'Rivu', '2024-11-29 21:46:15'),
